First milestone generator

- This will be a cli tool that accepts a directory full of artifacts and generates
    - a catalog of artifacts arranged by day
    - clustered by location
    - a geojson (or similar) document organizing and displaying the artifacts

Later Milestone ideas: do no do
- generate an attractive path that shows the progression on a map when traces are not available
- reduction of existing traces to thumbnail the event
